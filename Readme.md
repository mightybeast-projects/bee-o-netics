## 📃 Description ##
*Mr. GPT says:*
<br>
*Bee-o-netics is a cross-breeding and mutations game centered around bees. In this game, players delve into the world of bee genetics and explore the fascinating possibilities of creating new bee breeds through controlled breeding and genetic manipulation.*

*Gameplay revolves around managing a virtual bee farm or laboratory, where players have the ability to selectively breed different bee species with specific traits. These traits can include attributes such as ~~size~~, color, pattern, ~~behavior~~, productivity, ~~and resistance to diseases or environmental conditions~~.*

*Players start with a set of base bee species and gradually unlock new species by successfully breeding and evolving existing ones. The game offers a variety of genetic combinations and possibilities, allowing players to experiment and create unique bee breeds that possess desired traits.*
